SPECIFIC COMMENTS/FEEDBACK:

problem 1 findGCD.nasm
   works as advertised

problem 2 findGCDfunc.nasm & gcdFinder.c
   this LOOKS like it will work but it's hard to tell.  How did you get past
      the situation with having two "main()" programs in your code?  You
      have one main in the "findGCD.s" file with the funtion, and another in
      the "gcdFinder.c" file.  You didn't provide any of the required build
      information in the "C" file.  I'll take it on faith that your program
      will actually work, but it would be better to have done as the problem
      actually specified and put the function version into its own file that
      is named "findGCDfunc.s".  Slight loss of points for this.

problem 3 paritygen.nasm
   works as advertised.  Not sure why you didn't use "printf()" for handling
      the output rather than the entire "syscall" set up.  Still....

problem 4 whichEndIsUp.c
   this needed a correction for "u_int16_t" which should have been entered
      as "uint16_t'.  Once I made that correction, works as advertised.

problem 5 makeNBOC.c & makeNBOCtest.c
   works as advertised

problem 6 makeNBOC.c & makeNBON.nasm
   extra credit not attempted

========================================================
SEMESTER HOMEWORK TOTALS:

   Homework01  100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   Homework02   95.00% of  5 points =  4.75 points
   Homework03  102.10% of  5 points =  5.11 points
   Homework04   97.78% of  5 points =  4.89 points
   Homework05  100.00% of 10 points = 10.00 points
   homework06   96.34% of 15 points = 14.45 points
                      semester total: 44.10 out of 45.00 = 98.00%
                             which is an A-plus

Great work!  It's been wonderful having you three in class this semester!
Best wishes for a great holiday break and I look forward to seeing you all
around campus in the spring!
